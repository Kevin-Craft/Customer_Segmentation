Project:
Inspiration and direction for this project is from AbsentData.com. 
The full workshop describing the Python code is located: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwUli5gIcU0

The Powerpoint presentation is something I've created as an example of how I would present findings.
The project took around 6 hours to complete including the preparation of the report.

Data:
Data for this project was downloaded from: https://github.com/Gaelim/Mall-Customer-Segmentation/blob/main/Mall_Customers.csv\
The data was already clean and required very little manipulation to use in Python.
